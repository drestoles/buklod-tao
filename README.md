# Buklod Tao Mapping
This project builds upon the work initiated by practicum students during Intersession 2025. This also serves as an integrated requirement for SocSc 13 and NSTP 12.

It focuses on digitally mapping the community of Sitio Do√±a Pepeng in San Mateo, Rizal, with the goal of creating a functional and reliable map. This digital resource will support Buklod Tao in enhancing their disaster risk reduction and prevention efforts within their partner communities.
